# Text_File_Zipper
- File zipper project using the Huffman Algorithm
- Directions to implement:
  1. Download all the files
  2. Open terminal and change directory to where you have downloaded the files
  3. To compress the file ,Run the command g++ encode.cpp huffman.cpp -o main and ./ main 'name of file to be compressed' 'name of the compressed file with .huff
     extension'
  4. To decompress,Run the command g++ decode.cpp huffman.cpp -o main and ./ main 'name of the compressed file with .huff extension'  'name of the decompressed file'
- We achieved 50% compression with this project
